An ambitious software developer, and who would like to travel and join a team of like-minded developers.
A good experienced and creative engineer with more than 3 years of work experience in a variety of exciting projects.
I like traveling, video games, and DIY things. I enjoy sci-fi and fantasy stuff, and programming.

I build large and scalable web applications at work.
I dream of building tiny and useful applications at home.
